## Roadmap

This open-source repo is a work-in-progress currently. We plan to open source the backend of BuildShip which will allow you to export and deploy the workflows created on BuildShip on your own cloud if you choose to. Plus this repo will be an ecosystem of all connectors and trigger nodes for others to share and contribute to.
